## Project Description:

An Amazon-like storefront built using Node.js and MySQL. There are two views for the app: Customer and Manager. The Customer app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. The Manager app allows you to track product sales across the store's departments and then provides options to update stock and add new items.

## Technologies Used:

* Node.js
* Inquirer (NPM Package)
* MySQL
